Formal Letter

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my interest in the Mediterranean cruise advertised by your agency. My family and I are considering taking a cruise around the Mediterranean and we would like to know more about the package that your agency is offering.

In particular, we are curious about the organized activities that are available on the cruise. Could you please provide us with a list of the activities that are included? Additionally, we would like to know which resorts are included in the itinerary.

Another important consideration for us is the price of the cruise. We would like to know the full price of the package, as well as whether any discounts are available for groups. It would be helpful if you could provide us with some information about the different cabin options available on the cruise.

Finally, we are wondering if the cruise is available from 24th June to 8th July, as those are the dates that we are considering. If not, could you please provide us with information about the available dates?

We are a family of four, with two adults and two children aged 8 and 11. We are looking for a cruise that offers a variety of activities and experiences, and we are particularly interested in exploring the cultural and historical aspects of the Mediterranean region.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Radoslav
